## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to server" Error

**[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Error message in browser]**

**Problem:** Browser cannot find KnowledgeVault

2. Check the knowledgevault container shows "Running"
3. Try refreshing the browser page
4. Wait 30 seconds and try again

### "LLM Unavailable" Warning

**Problem:** KnowledgeVault cannot connect to Ollama

**Solution:**
1. Check Ollama is running:

   - Type: `ollama list`
   - You should see your models listed
2. If Ollama is not running, restart it
3. Refresh the KnowledgeVault page

### Documents Stuck on "Pending"

**[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Document list showing pending status]**

**Problem:** Documents are not being processed

**Solution:**
1. Wait 5 minutes (processing takes time)
2. Check Docker Desktop logs:
   - Click on the knowledgevault container
   - Click "Logs" tab
   - Look for error messages
3. Restart KnowledgeVault:
   ```
   docker compose restart
   ```

### Slow Responses

**Problem:** AI takes a long time to respond

**Solutions:**
1. Use a smaller, faster model (llama3.2 instead of qwen2.5:32b)
2. Close other programs to free up RAM
3. Upload fewer documents at once
4. Be patient - first response may be slow

### Out of Memory Error

**Problem:** Computer runs out of RAM

**Solutions:**
1. Use a smaller chat model
2. Close other applications
3. Process documents in smaller batches
4. Add more RAM to your computer
